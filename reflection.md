## Reflection Document

### HTML

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to complete the exercises on my own, and then checked the solutions to see how it was properly done.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  They were helpful to get a start on how HTML works and start to see best practices. The form excercise is probably one of my
  most refrenced pieces of code this term.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  Nope!

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  Popup windows might have been interesting to see, but those are more easily done in other ways.

### Accessibility

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to complete the exercises on my own, and then checked the solutions to see how it was properly done.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  They were very helpful for getting the accessability checking tools up and running, as well as familiarizing myself with their use.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  Nope!

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  Not that I can think of

### CSS

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to complete the exercises on my own. However, this started a pattern of me completing the lab on my own, looking at
  the solution, and being a surprised by how different my answer was to the posted solution. I then changed it to the posted
  answer to see what (if any) difference it made.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  Moderately helpful. With the benefits of hindsight, a lot of this functionality was replaced by newer technologies we learned later
  on in the term. Media queries were fun!

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  Layout was a challenge throughout the term. I dont know if it could have been explained better, but some examples that might show up
  in later homeworks (especially if that homework was not focused on layout....) would have been nice for a refrence

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  As above, layout was a challenge throughout the term. A bit more practice with sizing and using display: inline-block; would
  likely be appriciated

### Flexbox

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to complete the exercises on my own. However I did refrence the solutions much more closely in this section, basically checking
  the solutions after each question rather than at the end of all of the work. I felt far less confident about my results (in part because they
  did not look precisely the same as the screenshots even using the solutions)

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  The exercises were helpful with understanding how each part of flexbox worked, although the differences between browsers and resolutions caused
  some frustration.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  How to properly space the flex boxes, especially if they were not going to be consistantly spaced.

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  A more real world example of how flexbox was used to align differant parts of a website would be helpful. It might also be good for it to be
  suggestive of where you want us to use flexbox in future homeworks and exercises.

### CSS Grid

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  Similarly to the flexbox exercizes, I was able to complete them on my own but I was refrencing the solutions much more closely. This was (if memory
  serves) the first time I watched one of the videos to see how something was supposed to work. It was also the first time I was not certain the solution
  was correct, as for grid container 4 the exercise and solution both use a 600 px size for height, but when I was doing the exercise it looked
  more like the example when I used a 400 px height.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  Moderately helpful. Like flexbox, the difference between setups caused some confusion.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  The commented instructions for the heights in pixels should be moved to directly under the comment headers for the different sections so they are not easily
  missed. I had a bit of trouble with the first few exercises because I did not see that instruction.

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  Like flexbox, I would have liked to see a real world exercise, especially one that hinted at how to do future homework solutions.

### Bootstrap

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was somewhat strapped for time on this one, so I started out refrencing the solutions ahead of time as it was faster than searching through the refrences
  to find what I needed. I was still able to complete most of the exercises without relying on the solutions.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  I found them quite helpful in learning bootstrap. I dont think I used bootstrap much at all in the rest of the class however.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  Nope!

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  Nope! This time there were real world examples included!

### Javascript

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to complete the first four exercises on my own. However, my solutions varied a bit from the ones suggested and were much longer than
  those were. I also had issues getting my testing eviroment working to actually test my scripts, so I wound up testing both my own code and the
  solutions repeatedly until I fixed the issue. The last three exercises required me to refrence the solutions to find what I was doing wrong.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  Very helpful in helping to learn javascript. Somewhat less helpful in the sense that JS is finicky and has several solutions to any problem.
  some guidance on which solution is best would have been nice.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  How the fetching function was run. I scratched my head over that for a while.

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  Nope, these were pretty good, and relevant to what we see on a lot of websites today.

### jquery

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  I was able to complete most of them on my own, but my code was ugly and had uncessary parts. I would not have considered it a correct answer
  compared to the solution.

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  Setting up the ajax exercise to mimic the javascript fetch exercise was enlightening and showed a good comparison between the two methods.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  I definately felt like I did not understand the dom section well, but I cant tell if thats the lab, the lecure, or my own stress and exaustion towards
  the end of the term preventing me from absorbing as much of the lecture material.

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

  Nope, these were pretty effective!
